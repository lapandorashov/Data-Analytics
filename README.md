# Emory ISOM 499R Project - Wine Quality Prediction

The wine industry was one of the hardest hit markets by COVID-19, decreasing the industry’s projected 2020 revenue by 14 percent. Its negative effects were compounded by other crises, like climate change and the frequency of wildfires in some of the world’s top wine producing regions. Due to this financial loss, wine companies have had to downscale their portfolio and be more selective regarding the quality of their products. To tackle this problem, our group has decided to build a classification model to predict if a wine is qualified to be on the market; we hope that increasing the quality of their products will drive an increase in revenue.
